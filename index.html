    <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline and a few great achievements of Newton:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>1642:</strong> -Birth of Isaac Newton in Woolsthorpe, England</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1654</strong> -Newton enrolls in the Grantham Grammar School
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1661</strong> -Newton enrolls in Trinity College, Cambridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1665</strong> -Newton receives his bachelor of arts from Trinity College
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1665</strong> -Isaac Newton is credited with discovering the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any rational exponent, in 1665. It remains to be used extensively in mathematics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1665</strong> - In 1665, Newton began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus, the mathematical study of change. Calculus gave mathematicians for the first time a powerful form of analysis to find the slopes of curves and areas under curves.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1668</strong> - Isaac Newton invented the first successful reflecting telescope, now known as the Newtonian telescope. The telescope until then was a large and cumbersome instrument. Newton’s telescope, which used mirrors instead of lenses, was a more powerful instrument and ten times smaller than traditional telescopes. The simple design of the Newtonian telescope makes it still quite among amateur astronomers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1670</strong> -In late 1660s and early 1670s, Isaac Newton famously determined that white light was a mix of colours which can be separated into its component parts with a prism. He also showed that the multi-coloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Thus Newton was able to counter the then held believe that light is simple and homogeneous; and prove that it is complex and heterogeneous.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
        season, doubling wheat yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1674</strong> -·Hooke writes book in which he suggests existence of "attractive powers," akin to gravity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1684</strong> - Newton completes his calculations on gravity and shares them with Halley, who urges him to publish.
      </li>·Newton presents the first book of the Principia to the Royal Society.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1687</strong> -Newton first compiled his three laws of motion, inertia, F = ma and action-reaction.   Newton’s laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years and they still remain excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life. They laid the foundation of classical mechanics due to which it is also widely known as Newtonian mechanics. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1687</strong> -Newton formulated his law of universal gravitation which states that any two bodies in the universe attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Among other things, the revolutionary law helped in explaining phenomena such as the tides and trajectories of comets.
 </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1693</strong> - Newton's "Black Year." He is plagued by depression and insomnia, and apparently suffers a nervous breakdown in September.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1704</strong> Publication of Opticks; beginning of feud with Leibniz.</li>
     <li><strong>1713</strong> Second edition of the Principia published.</li>
    <li><strong>1727</strong> Death of Sir Isaac Newton, in London.</li>
